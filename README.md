# Java quines

A [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)) is a computer program that outputs its own source code.

In 1998, we set out a challenge for some students that we were teaching Java: They were to create the shortest
Java code that outputs itself. In the end, it became a challenge for us tutors. I found a [solution](https://snailshell.de/java.html)
that needed merely 208 bytes. More recent Java versions need even fewer bytes:

- [Java 1.0 quine](src/main/java/S.java) (208 bytes)
- [Java 1.5 quine](src/main/java/U.java) (172 bytes): Uses `printf` instead of `print`
- [Java 10 quine](src/main/java/V.java) (166 bytes): Uses `var` instead of `String` type declaration

The actual quines are linked above. But as they are one-liners (for briefness), they are pretty hard to read.
So here is my Java 1.0 quine, formatted slightly better:

```java
class S {
    public static void main(String[] a) {
        System.out.print((s += (char) 34) + s + ';' + '}');
    }

    static String s = "class S{public static void main(String[]a){System.out.print((s+=(char)34)+s+';'+'}');}static String s=";
}
```

And, for comparison, the Java 10 quine with better formatting:

```java
class V {
    public static void main(String[] a) {
        var f = "class V{public static void main(String[]a){var f=%c%s%1$c;System.out.printf(f,34,f);}}";
        System.out.printf(f, 34, f);
    }
}
```

Remember, these formatted code examples are *no* quines â€“ but they are easier to read to get the idea how quines work.

While the Java 1.0 quine is completely my own work, the Java 1.5 version
is based on [this example](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(Computerprogramm)#Beispiele) IIRC.
I then used the Java 1.5 code to write the even shorter version for Java 10+.
